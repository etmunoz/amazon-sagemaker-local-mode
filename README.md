## Amazon SageMaker Local Mode Examples

This repository contains examples and related resources showing you how to preprocess, train, debug your training script with breakpoints, and serve on your local machine using Amazon SageMaker Local mode for processing jobs, training and serving. 

## Overview

The local mode in the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK can emulate CPU (single and multi-instance) and GPU (single instance) SageMaker training jobs by changing a single argument in the TensorFlow, PyTorch or MXNet estimators.  To do this, it uses Docker compose and NVIDIA Docker.  It will also pull the Amazon SageMaker TensorFlow, PyTorch or MXNet containers from Amazon ECS, so youâ€™ll need to be able to access a public Amazon ECR repository from your local environment.

## SageMaker local mode training and serving in PyCharm
This repository examples will work in any IDE on your local machine. 

Here you can see a TensorFlow example running on PyCharm. **The data for training and serving is also located on your local machine file system**.

### Repository Structure

The repository contains the following resources:

- **TensorFlow resources:**  

  - [**TensorFlow Script Mode Training and Serving**](tensorflow_script_mode_local_training_and_serving):  This example shows how to train and serve your model with TensorFlow and SageMaker script mode, on your local machine using SageMaker local mode.
  - [**TensorFlow Script Mode Debug Training Script**](tensorflow_script_mode_debug_local_training):  This example shows how to debug your training script running inside a prebuilt SageMaker Docker image for TensorFlow, on your local machine using SageMaker local mode.
  - [**TensorFlow Script Mode Deploy a Trained Model and inference on file from S3**](tensorflow_script_mode_local_model_inference):  This example shows how to deploy a trained model to a SageMaker endpoint, on your local machine using SageMaker local mode, and inference with a file in S3 instead of http payload for the SageMaker Endpoint.
  
- **PyTorch resources:**  

  - [**PyTorch Script Mode Training and Serving**](pytorch_script_mode_local_training_and_serving):  This example shows how to train and serve your model with PyTorch and SageMaker script mode, on your local machine using SageMaker local mode.
